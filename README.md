Intuitionistic theorem prover
Written by Roy Dyckhoff, Summer 1991
Modified to use the LWB syntax  Summer 1997
and simplified in various ways...

Translated to Haskell by Lennart Augustsson December 2005

Incorporates the Vorob'ev-Hudelmaier etc calculus (I call it LJT)
See RD's paper in JSL 1992:
"Contraction-free calculi for intuitionistic logic"

Torkel Franzen (at SICS) gave me good ideas about how to write this
properly, taking account of first-argument indexing,
and I learnt a trick or two from Neil Tennant's "Autologic" book.
